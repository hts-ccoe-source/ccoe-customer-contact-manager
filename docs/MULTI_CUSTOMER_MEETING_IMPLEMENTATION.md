# Multi-Customer Meeting Implementation Summary

## Overview

Task 25 has been successfully implemented, adding Microsoft Graph API meeting functionality with SES topic integration that supports multiple customers. This implementation allows creating unified meeting invites by aggregating recipients from the `aws-calendar` SES topic across multiple customer organizations.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Multi-Customer Recipient Aggregation

- **Function**: `queryAndAggregateCalendarRecipients()`
- **Purpose**: Queries the `aws-calendar` SES topic from all affected customers concurrently
- **Features**:
  - **Concurrent processing**: Queries all customers simultaneously using goroutines
  - Assumes customer-specific SES roles for each customer
  - Queries topic subscribers from each customer's SES service in parallel
  - Deduplicates email addresses across all customers
  - Provides detailed logging of the aggregation process with success/error counts
  - **Performance optimized**: Significantly faster for multiple customers

### 2. Unified Meeting Creation

- **Function**: `CreateMultiCustomerMeetingInvite()`
- **Purpose**: Creates a single meeting invite with all aggregated recipients
- **Features**:
  - Extracts customer codes from metadata JSON files
  - Supports both flat and nested metadata formats
  - Creates unified Microsoft Graph API meeting payload
  - Bypasses normal SES email workflow for meeting requests

### 3. Lambda Integration for Automatic Scheduling

- **Function**: `ScheduleMultiCustomerMeetingIfNeeded()`
- **Purpose**: Automatically schedules meetings when changes are approved
- **Features**:
  - **Trigger**: Activated during `approved_announcement` processing
  - **Meeting detection**: Checks metadata for meeting requirements
  - **Auto-scheduling**: Multi-customer changes with implementation schedules
  - **Non-blocking**: Meeting failures don't prevent email notifications
  - **Temporary metadata**: Creates compatible metadata format for meeting functions

### 4. Customer Code Extraction

- **Function**: `extractCustomerCodesFromMetadata()`
- **Purpose**: Extracts customer codes from various metadata formats
- **Supported Formats**:
  - Flat format: `{"customers": ["hts", "htsnonprod"]}`
  - Nested format: `{"changeMetadata": {"customerCodes": ["hts", "htsnonprod"]}}`
  - Generic JSON with multiple field name variations
  - Backward compatibility with existing metadata structures

## CLI Interface

### New Action: `create-multi-customer-meeting-invite`

```bash
./ccoe-customer-contact-manager ses --action create-multi-customer-meeting-invite \
  --topic-name aws-calendar \
  --json-metadata metadata.json \
  --sender-email notifications@example.com \
  --dry-run
```

**Parameters:**

- `--topic-name`: SES topic to query (typically `aws-calendar`)
- `--json-metadata`: Path to metadata JSON file containing customer codes and meeting details
- `--sender-email`: Email address of the meeting organizer
- `--dry-run`: Preview mode showing recipients without creating meeting
- `--force-update`: Force update existing meetings regardless of detected changes

## Workflow Implementation

### 1. Multi-Customer Meeting Request Flow

```
1. Extract customer codes from metadata JSON
2. **Concurrently for all customers** (using goroutines):
   - Assume customer-specific SES role
   - Query aws-calendar topic subscribers
   - Collect recipient email addresses
3. Aggregate and deduplicate all recipients from concurrent results
4. Generate Microsoft Graph API meeting payload
5. Create unified meeting via Graph API
```

### 2. Error Handling and Resilience

- **Customer-level isolation**: Failures in one customer don't affect others
- **Graceful degradation**: Continues processing even if some customers fail
- **Concurrent processing**: All customers queried simultaneously for optimal performance
- **Comprehensive logging**: Detailed progress and error reporting with success/error counts

## Testing

### Unit Tests

- **File**: `internal/ses/meetings_test.go`
- **Coverage**:
  - Recipient deduplication logic
  - Customer code extraction from various formats
  - Microsoft Graph API integration
  - Concurrent recipient gathering across customers
  - Mock credential manager functionality

### Integration Testing

- **Test file**: `test-multi-customer-meeting-metadata.json`
- **Verified functionality**:
  - Customer code extraction: `[hts, htsnonprod]`
  - Dry-run mode operation
  - CLI parameter validation
  - Help documentation display

## Configuration Requirements

### Microsoft Graph API Setup

1. **Azure AD App Registration** with permissions:
   - `Calendars.ReadWrite` (Application permission)
   - Admin consent granted

2. **Environment Variables** (loaded from AWS Parameter Store):
   - `/azure/client-id`
   - `/azure/client-secret`
   - `/azure/tenant-id`

### Customer Configuration

- Each customer must have SES service configured
- Customer-specific IAM roles for SES access
- `aws-calendar` topic configured in each customer's SES

## Documentation Updates

### README.md Enhancements

- Added `create-multi-customer-meeting-invite` action documentation
- Explained multi-customer workflow and recipient aggregation
- Updated feature list to include multi-customer support
- Added automatic fallback documentation

### Help System

- Integrated new action into CLI help system
- Proper categorization under email & notifications section
- Clear parameter descriptions and usage examples

## Requirements Compliance

✅ **Requirement 5.2**: Create function to query aws-calendar SES topic from all affected customers  
✅ **Requirement 5.8**: Implement recipient aggregation and deduplication across multiple customers  
✅ **Requirement 1.1**: Add Microsoft Graph API authentication and credential management  
✅ **Requirement 1.2**: Write create-meeting function using Microsoft Graph API  
✅ **Requirement 5.2**: Implement special workflow routing for meeting requests (bypass normal SES email)  
✅ **Add meeting metadata validation and formatting**  
✅ **Create error handling for Graph API failures**  
✅ **Add dry-run support for meeting creation operations**  
✅ **Write unit tests for recipient aggregation and Graph API integration**  

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Enhanced Error Recovery**: Retry logic for transient Graph API failures
2. **Meeting Templates**: Configurable meeting templates for different change types
3. **Attendee Management**: Support for optional vs required attendees
4. **Calendar Integration**: Integration with other calendar systems beyond Microsoft Graph
5. **Metrics and Monitoring**: CloudWatch metrics for meeting creation success rates

### Scalability Considerations

- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in rate limiting for SES API calls
- **Concurrent Processing**: ✅ **Implemented** - Parallel customer queries for optimal performance
- **Caching**: Potential caching of customer configurations and topic subscribers
- **Batch Operations**: Support for creating multiple meetings in batch

## Conclusion

Task 25 has been successfully implemented with comprehensive multi-customer meeting functionality. The implementation provides robust error handling and maintains backward compatibility with existing single-customer workflows. The solution properly aggregates recipients across multiple customer organizations while maintaining security boundaries and providing detailed operational visibility through Microsoft Graph API integration.
