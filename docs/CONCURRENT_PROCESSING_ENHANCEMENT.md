# Concurrent Processing Enhancement

## Overview

The multi-customer meeting functionality has been enhanced to gather recipients across organizations concurrently, significantly improving performance when processing multiple customers.

## Implementation Details

### Before: Sequential Processing
```go
for _, customerCode := range customerCodes {
    // Process each customer one by one
    customerRecipients, err := queryCustomer(customerCode)
    // ... handle results
}
```

**Performance Characteristics:**
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n = number of customers
- **Total Time**: Sum of all individual customer query times
- **Example**: 5 customers × 2 seconds each = 10 seconds total

### After: Concurrent Processing
```go
// Launch goroutines for each customer
for _, customerCode := range customerCodes {
    go func(code string) {
        recipients, err := queryCustomerRecipients(credentialManager, code, topicName)
        resultChan <- CustomerRecipientResult{
            CustomerCode: code,
            Recipients:   recipients,
            Error:        err,
        }
    }(customerCode)
}

// Collect results from all goroutines
for i := 0; i < len(customerCodes); i++ {
    result := <-resultChan
    // ... process results
}
```

**Performance Characteristics:**
- **Time Complexity**: O(1) - all customers processed simultaneously
- **Total Time**: Maximum time of any single customer query
- **Example**: 5 customers, longest query 2 seconds = 2 seconds total

## Performance Benefits

### Speed Improvement
| Number of Customers | Sequential Time | Concurrent Time | Speed Improvement |
|-------------------|----------------|----------------|------------------|
| 2 customers       | 4 seconds      | 2 seconds      | **2x faster**    |
| 5 customers       | 10 seconds     | 2 seconds      | **5x faster**    |
| 10 customers      | 20 seconds     | 2 seconds      | **10x faster**   |
| 30 customers      | 60 seconds     | 2 seconds      | **30x faster**   |

*Assumes average 2-second query time per customer*

### Resource Utilization
- **CPU**: Better utilization of multi-core systems
- **Network**: Parallel network requests to different AWS accounts
- **Memory**: Minimal additional memory overhead for goroutines
- **Latency**: Reduced overall latency for multi-customer operations

## Technical Implementation

### New Components

#### 1. CustomerRecipientResult Structure
```go
type CustomerRecipientResult struct {
    CustomerCode string
    Recipients   []string
    Error        error
}
```

#### 2. Concurrent Query Function
```go
func queryAndAggregateCalendarRecipients(credentialManager CredentialManager, customerCodes []string, topicName string) ([]string, error)
```

#### 3. Individual Customer Query Function
```go
func queryCustomerRecipients(credentialManager CredentialManager, customerCode string, topicName string) ([]string, error)
```

### Error Handling

**Isolation**: Errors in one customer don't affect others
```go
if result.Error != nil {
    fmt.Printf("⚠️  Warning: Failed to get recipients for customer %s: %v\n", result.CustomerCode, result.Error)
    errorCount++
    continue // Continue processing other customers
}
```

**Comprehensive Reporting**: 
```
📊 Aggregation complete: 150 unique recipients from 5 customers (4 successful, 1 errors)
```

### Concurrency Safety

- **Channel-based communication**: Uses Go channels for safe data passing
- **No shared state**: Each goroutine operates independently
- **Deduplication**: Performed after all results are collected
- **Resource cleanup**: Goroutines automatically cleaned up after completion

## Testing

### Unit Tests Added

#### 1. Concurrent Processing Structure Test
```go
func TestConcurrentRecipientGathering(t *testing.T)
```
- Verifies goroutine-based processing
- Tests result channel communication
- Validates all customers are processed

#### 2. Existing Tests Enhanced
- Deduplication logic remains unchanged
- Customer code extraction unaffected
- Graph API integration preserved

### Integration Testing

**Dry-run verification**:
```bash
./ccoe-customer-contact-manager ses --action create-multi-customer-meeting-invite \
  --topic-name aws-calendar \
  --json-metadata test-multi-customer-meeting-metadata.json \
  --sender-email test@hearst.com --dry-run

# Output shows concurrent processing:
# 📋 Querying aws-calendar topic from 2 customers concurrently...
# 🔍 Querying customer: hts
# 🔍 Querying customer: htsnonprod
```

## Backward Compatibility

### CLI Interface
- **No changes**: Same commands and parameters
- **Same output format**: Logging enhanced but format preserved
- **Same error handling**: Error isolation improved but behavior consistent

### Configuration
- **No config changes**: Uses existing customer mappings
- **Same credentials**: Uses existing SES role assumptions
- **Same permissions**: No additional AWS permissions required

## Monitoring and Observability

### Enhanced Logging
```
📋 Querying aws-calendar topic from 5 customers concurrently...
🔍 Querying customer: customer-a
🔍 Querying customer: customer-b
🔍 Querying customer: customer-c
📧 Customer customer-a: found 25 recipients
📧 Customer customer-b: found 18 recipients
⚠️  Warning: Failed to get recipients for customer customer-c: access denied
📊 Aggregation complete: 43 unique recipients from 3 customers (2 successful, 1 errors)
```

### Performance Metrics
- **Success/Error counts**: Clear visibility into customer processing results
- **Timing information**: Implicit in concurrent vs sequential processing
- **Recipient counts**: Per-customer and total aggregated counts

## Future Enhancements

### Rate Limiting
- **Current**: No rate limiting (relies on AWS SDK defaults)
- **Future**: Configurable rate limiting per customer or globally

### Timeout Handling
- **Current**: Uses AWS SDK default timeouts
- **Future**: Configurable timeouts for customer queries

### Retry Logic
- **Current**: Single attempt per customer
- **Future**: Configurable retry logic for transient failures

### Connection Pooling
- **Current**: New connections per customer
- **Future**: Connection pooling for improved resource utilization

## Conclusion

The concurrent processing enhancement provides significant performance improvements for multi-customer meeting functionality while maintaining full backward compatibility. The implementation scales linearly with the number of customers, making it suitable for the target ~30 customer organizations and beyond.
