# S3 Lifecycle Policy Removal Summary

## Overview

Removed S3 lifecycle policies from the `4cm-prod-ccoe-change-management-metadata` bucket as part of implementing the Transient Trigger Pattern. The backend now handles immediate cleanup of trigger files after processing, eliminating the need for time-based lifecycle policies.

## Changes Made

### 1. AWS S3 Lifecycle Policy Removal

**Bucket**: `4cm-prod-ccoe-change-management-metadata`

**Previous Configuration**:
- Lifecycle rule ID: "base"
- Expiration: 90 days for all objects (empty prefix)
- Noncurrent version expiration: 90 days
- Abort incomplete multipart uploads: 7 days

**Action Taken**:
```bash
aws s3api delete-bucket-lifecycle --bucket 4cm-prod-ccoe-change-management-metadata
```

**Verification**:
```bash
aws s3api get-bucket-lifecycle-configuration --bucket 4cm-prod-ccoe-change-management-metadata
# Returns: NoSuchLifecycleConfiguration (expected - policy successfully removed)
```

### 2. Documentation Updates

#### Design Document (.kiro/specs/multi-customer-email-distribution/design.md)

**Updated S3 Structure Description**:
- Changed: `customers/ # Operational files (30-day lifecycle)`
- To: `customers/ # Transient trigger files (deleted by backend after processing)`

**Updated Cleanup Management**:
- Changed: `Lifecycle Management: Automatic cleanup of customers/ prefix after 30 days`
- To: `Cleanup Management: Backend deletes customers/ trigger files immediately after processing`

**Updated Terraform Module Example**:
- Removed: `lifecycle_rules` configuration block
- Added: Comment explaining backend handles immediate cleanup

#### Requirements Document (.kiro/specs/multi-customer-email-distribution/requirements.md)

**Updated Requirement 8.7**:
- Changed: "WHEN managing lifecycle policies THEN S3 SHALL automatically clean up operational files in customers/ prefixes after 30 days"
- To: "WHEN processing triggers THEN the backend SHALL delete customers/ trigger files immediately after successful processing"

#### README.md

**Updated Configuration Example**:
- Removed: `lifecyclePolicies` configuration section
- Added: Comment explaining backend handles immediate cleanup

## Rationale

### Why Remove Lifecycle Policies?

1. **Transient Trigger Pattern**: The new architecture uses customers/ objects as transient triggers that are deleted immediately after processing, not as long-term storage

2. **Immediate Cleanup**: Backend deletes trigger files within seconds/minutes of processing, making 30-90 day lifecycle policies unnecessary

3. **Cost Optimization**: Immediate deletion reduces storage costs compared to waiting for lifecycle policy execution

4. **Cleaner Architecture**: Clear separation between operational triggers (customers/) and permanent storage (archive/)

5. **Prevents Confusion**: No orphaned trigger files that might be mistaken for unprocessed changes

### Storage Architecture

**customers/{code}/{changeId}.json**:
- Purpose: Transient triggers for S3 event notifications
- Lifecycle: Created by frontend → Triggers SQS → Processed by backend → Deleted immediately
- Duration: Seconds to minutes (not days)

**archive/{changeId}.json**:
- Purpose: Single source of truth for all change data
- Lifecycle: Created on submission → Updated with processing results → Permanent storage
- Duration: Indefinite (no expiration)

**drafts/{changeId}.json**:
- Purpose: Working copies for editing
- Lifecycle: Created during editing → Deleted on submission (optional)
- Duration: User-controlled (no automatic expiration)

## Backend Cleanup Implementation

The backend implements immediate cleanup in the processing workflow:

```go
// Step 4: Update archive with processing results
err = s3Client.PutObject(archiveKey, changeData)
if err != nil {
    // Delete trigger but do NOT acknowledge SQS (allows retry)
    _ = s3Client.DeleteObject(triggerKey)
    return fmt.Errorf("failed to update archive: %w", err)
}

// Step 5: Delete trigger (cleanup)
err = s3Client.DeleteObject(triggerKey)
if err != nil {
    log.Warn("Failed to delete trigger, but processing complete", "error", err)
    // Non-fatal - processing is complete
}
```

## Verification Steps

1. ✅ Confirmed lifecycle policy existed (90-day expiration on all objects)
2. ✅ Removed lifecycle policy using AWS CLI
3. ✅ Verified removal (NoSuchLifecycleConfiguration error expected)
4. ✅ Updated design documentation
5. ✅ Updated requirements documentation
6. ✅ Updated README configuration examples
7. ✅ Documented rationale and new cleanup mechanism

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Impacts

- **Faster Cleanup**: Trigger files deleted within minutes instead of days
- **Lower Storage Costs**: Minimal storage usage in customers/ prefix
- **Clearer Architecture**: Obvious distinction between triggers and permanent storage
- **Better Monitoring**: Can track trigger creation/deletion rates in real-time

### No Negative Impacts

- Backend already implements immediate cleanup (tasks 26-28 completed)
- Archive files remain permanent (no lifecycle policy needed)
- Draft files are user-controlled (no automatic expiration needed)
