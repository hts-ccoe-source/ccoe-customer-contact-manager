# Critical Fix: Merge Modifications Array in Cancel/Complete Handlers

## Problem

Meeting cancellation was not working even though:
1. Frontend was reloading the change from server (getting latest meeting metadata)
2. Frontend was sending the complete change object with `modifications` array
3. Backend was receiving the request

**The cancellation email was sent, but the meeting was NOT cancelled.**

## Root Cause

The Lambda handlers for `handleCancelChange` and `handleCompleteChange` were **ignoring the request body** and only using the change object from S3:

```javascript
// WRONG - Ignores request body
async function handleCancelChange(event, userEmail) {
    // Get change from S3
    const data = await s3.getObject({ Bucket, Key }).promise();
    let existingChange = JSON.parse(data.Body.toString());
    
    // Create cancelled change from S3 version (missing meeting metadata!)
    const cancelledChange = {
        ...existingChange,  // ‚Üê S3 version doesn't have meeting_scheduled modification
        status: 'cancelled',
        ...
    };
    
    // Upload to customer buckets ‚Üí triggers S3 event
    // Backend processes S3 event ‚Üí calls GetLatestMeetingMetadata()
    // Returns null because modifications array is incomplete!
}
```

## The Timeline Issue

1. **T0**: User approves change ‚Üí Meeting scheduled ‚Üí `meeting_scheduled` modification added to S3
2. **T1**: User loads "My Changes" page ‚Üí Frontend caches changes (may not have latest S3 version yet)
3. **T2**: User clicks "Cancel" ‚Üí Frontend reloads from server ‚Üí Gets latest with meeting metadata
4. **T3**: Frontend sends complete change object to `/changes/{id}/cancel` endpoint
5. **T4**: Lambda handler receives request ‚Üí **IGNORES request body** ‚Üí Reads from S3 instead
6. **T5**: Lambda creates cancelled change from S3 version ‚Üí Uploads to customer buckets
7. **T6**: S3 event triggers backend Lambda ‚Üí Reads change from S3 ‚Üí Missing meeting metadata!
8. **T7**: Backend calls `GetLatestMeetingMetadata()` ‚Üí Returns `null` ‚Üí Cannot cancel meeting

## The Fix

Merge the `modifications` array from the request body into the S3 change object:

```javascript
async function handleCancelChange(event, userEmail) {
    // Parse request body to get meeting metadata from frontend
    let changeFromRequest = null;
    if (event.body) {
        try {
            changeFromRequest = JSON.parse(event.body);
            console.log('üì• Received change object from request body for cancel');
            console.log('üìã Request has modifications array:', !!changeFromRequest.modifications);
            if (changeFromRequest.modifications) {
                console.log('üìã Modifications count:', changeFromRequest.modifications.length);
                const meetingMod = changeFromRequest.modifications.find(m => m.modification_type === 'meeting_scheduled');
                if (meetingMod) {
                    console.log('‚úÖ Found meeting_scheduled modification in request');
                    console.log('üìã Meeting ID:', meetingMod.meeting_metadata?.meeting_id);
                }
            }
        } catch (parseError) {
            console.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è  Failed to parse request body:', parseError);
        }
    }
    
    // Get existing change from S3
    const data = await s3.getObject({ Bucket, Key }).promise();
    let existingChange = JSON.parse(data.Body.toString());
    
    // CRITICAL: Merge modifications array from request body
    // The frontend has the latest version with meeting_scheduled modification
    if (changeFromRequest && changeFromRequest.modifications && Array.isArray(changeFromRequest.modifications)) {
        existingChange.modifications = changeFromRequest.modifications;
        console.log('‚úÖ Merged modifications array from request body');
        console.log('üìã Merged modifications count:', existingChange.modifications.length);
    } else {
        console.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è  No modifications array in request body, using S3 version');
    }
    
    // Now create cancelled change with complete modifications array
    const cancelledChange = {
        ...existingChange,  // ‚Üê Now has meeting metadata!
        status: 'cancelled',
        ...
    };
    
    // Upload to customer buckets ‚Üí Backend can now find meeting metadata!
}
```

## Why This Works

1. **Frontend sends fresh data**: The reloaded change object has the complete `modifications` array
2. **Lambda merges modifications**: Takes the modifications array from request body
3. **S3 write includes metadata**: The cancelled change written to S3 has meeting metadata
4. **Backend finds meeting**: `GetLatestMeetingMetadata()` finds the `meeting_scheduled` modification
5. **Meeting cancelled**: Backend successfully cancels the Microsoft Graph meeting

## Functions Updated

1. **handleCancelChange()** - Merges modifications array from request body
2. **handleCompleteChange()** - Merges modifications array from request body

## Testing

After this fix:

1. **Create and approve a change** with meeting required
2. **Wait for meeting to be scheduled** (check email for meeting invite)
3. **Click Cancel** button
4. **Check browser console** - should see:
   - "‚úÖ Reloaded change from server with latest meeting metadata"
   - "‚úÖ Found meeting_scheduled modification"
5. **Check Lambda logs** - should see:
   - "üì• Received change object from request body for cancel"
   - "‚úÖ Merged modifications array from request body"
   - "üìã Merged modifications count: 3" (or however many modifications)
6. **Check backend logs** - should see:
   - "üìÖ Found scheduled meeting for change..."
   - "‚úÖ Successfully cancelled Graph meeting..."
7. **Check email** - should receive cancellation notification
8. **Check Microsoft Teams** - meeting should be cancelled

## Files Modified

- `lambda/upload_lambda/upload-metadata-lambda.js`:
  - `handleCancelChange()` - Added request body parsing and modifications array merging
  - `handleCompleteChange()` - Added request body parsing and modifications array merging

## Related Fixes

This fix builds on:
1. **Frontend reload fix** - Ensures frontend has latest meeting metadata before sending
2. **Backend DELETE fix** - Similar pattern of merging request body with S3 data
3. **Meeting metadata preservation spec** - Original spec that identified the issue

## Key Insight

The problem wasn't just about sending the data - it was about the Lambda handlers **using** the data that was sent. The handlers were reading from S3 instead of using the request body, which meant all the frontend work to reload and send fresh data was being ignored.

This is a common pattern in distributed systems: **always check if the data you're sending is actually being used by the receiver!**
