# Announcement Processor Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented Task 22: "Separate announcement processing from change processing" to fix the "Untitled announcement" bug and ensure data integrity for announcements.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. AnnouncementProcessor (`internal/processors/announcement_processor.go`)

Created a dedicated processor for announcements with the following capabilities:

**Core Structure:**
- `AnnouncementProcessor` struct with S3, SES, and Graph clients
- Processes announcements based on status (submitted, approved, cancelled, completed)
- Works directly with `AnnouncementMetadata` - NO conversion to `ChangeMetadata`

**Status Handlers:**
- `handleSubmitted()`: Sends approval request emails
- `handleApproved()`: Schedules meetings (if needed) and sends announcement emails
- `handleCancelled()`: Cancels meetings and sends cancellation emails
- `handleCompleted()`: Sends completion emails

**Email Functions:**
- `sendApprovalRequest()`: Sends approval request to approvers
- `sendAnnouncementEmails()`: Sends type-specific announcement emails
- `sendCancellationEmail()`: Sends cancellation notifications
- `sendCompletionEmail()`: Sends completion notifications
- `sendEmailViaSES()`: Core email sending using SES topic management

**Helper Functions:**
- `convertToAnnouncementData()`: Converts AnnouncementMetadata to AnnouncementData for templates
- `getTopicNameForAnnouncementType()`: Maps announcement types to SES topics
- `getSubscribedContactsForTopic()`: Gets subscribers for a specific topic
- `SaveAnnouncementToS3()`: Saves announcement back to S3

**Meeting Functions (Placeholders):**
- `scheduleMeeting()`: Placeholder for Microsoft Graph integration
- `cancelMeeting()`: Placeholder for meeting cancellation

### 2. Announcement Handlers (`internal/lambda/announcement_handlers.go`)

Created separate event handlers for announcements:

**Main Handler:**
- `handleAnnouncementEventNew()`: Entry point for announcement processing
- Downloads announcement from S3 as `AnnouncementMetadata`
- Validates announcement structure
- Creates `AnnouncementProcessor` and delegates processing

**Helper Functions:**
- `downloadAnnouncementFromS3()`: Downloads and parses AnnouncementMetadata
- `validateAnnouncement()`: Validates required fields
- Status-specific handlers for each announcement status

**Routing Update:**
- Updated `handlers.go` to route `announcement_*` object types to new handler
- Changed from `handleAnnouncementEvent()` to `handleAnnouncementEventNew()`

### 3. Email Templates (`internal/ses/announcement_templates.go`)

Enhanced email templates with additional functions:

**New Template Functions:**
- `GetAnnouncementApprovalRequestTemplate()`: Approval request emails
- `GetAnnouncementCancellationTemplate()`: Cancellation notifications
- `GetAnnouncementCompletionTemplate()`: Completion notifications

**Data Structure Updates:**
- Updated `AnnouncementData` to include `Author` and `PostedDate` fields
- Changed `Attachments` from `[]AttachmentInfo` to `[]string` for simplicity
- Fixed all template rendering to use string attachments

**Template Types:**
- CIC (Cloud Innovator Community): Blue theme
- FinOps: Green theme
- InnerSource: Purple theme
- Generic: Blue theme

### 4. Cleanup Script (`scripts/delete-broken-announcements.sh`)

Created bash script to delete broken announcements:

**Features:**
- Scans S3 bucket for announcement objects
- Identifies objects with `object_type` starting with "announcement_"
- Supports dry-run mode (default)
- Provides detailed summary of deletions
- Verifies cleanup completion

**Usage:**
```bash
# Dry run
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket ./delete-broken-announcements.sh

# Actual deletion
S3_BUCKET_NAME=your-bucket DRY_RUN=false ./delete-broken-announcements.sh
```

### 5. Documentation

Created comprehensive documentation:

**Announcement Cleanup Guide (`docs/ANNOUNCEMENT_CLEANUP_GUIDE.md`):**
- Background on why cleanup is necessary
- Step-by-step cleanup process
- Post-cleanup verification
- Rollback plan

**Announcement Processor Architecture (`docs/ANNOUNCEMENT_PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE.md`):**
- Complete architecture diagram
- Data flow diagrams
- Key design principles
- SES topic mapping
- Error handling strategy
- Monitoring and alerting
- Troubleshooting guide

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. No Data Conversion

**Problem:** Previous implementation converted `AnnouncementMetadata` to `ChangeMetadata`, causing data loss.

**Solution:** Announcements remain as `AnnouncementMetadata` throughout their entire lifecycle.

```go
// OLD (BROKEN)
var announcement types.AnnouncementMetadata
json.Unmarshal(data, &announcement)
metadata := convertToChangeMetadata(announcement) // DATA LOSS

// NEW (CORRECT)
var announcement types.AnnouncementMetadata
json.Unmarshal(data, &announcement)
processor.ProcessAnnouncement(ctx, customerCode, &announcement, bucket, key)
```

### 2. Separation of Concerns

- **Handlers**: Route events and validate data
- **Processor**: Business logic and orchestration
- **Templates**: Email rendering and formatting

### 3. Type Safety

All functions work with `*types.AnnouncementMetadata` directly:

```go
func (p *AnnouncementProcessor) ProcessAnnouncement(
    ctx context.Context,
    customerCode string,
    announcement *types.AnnouncementMetadata,  // NOT ChangeMetadata
    s3Bucket, s3Key string,
) error
```

### 4. Meeting Integration (Future)

Meeting scheduling and cancellation are stubbed out with placeholders:
- Logs intent but doesn't block processing
- Ready for Microsoft Graph API integration
- Preserves announcement processing flow

## What Was NOT Implemented

### 1. Microsoft Graph API Integration

Meeting scheduling and cancellation are placeholders:
- `scheduleMeeting()`: Logs intent, returns success
- `cancelMeeting()`: Logs intent, returns success

**Reason:** Requires significant refactoring to extract meeting functions from lambda package to shared location.

**Future Work:** 
- Extract `MeetingScheduler` to shared package
- Implement Graph API calls in `AnnouncementProcessor`
- Update S3 with meeting metadata

### 2. Graph Token Retrieval

Graph token retrieval is stubbed in handlers:
```go
graphToken := "" // TODO: Implement token retrieval
```

**Reason:** Token management is currently in lambda package.

**Future Work:**
- Extract token management to shared package
- Implement token caching
- Add token refresh logic

## Testing Status

### Unit Tests

## Known Issues

### 1. Meeting Scheduling Not Implemented

**Impact:** Announcements with `include_meeting: true` won't schedule meetings

**Workaround:** Manually schedule meetings or implement Graph API integration

**Priority:** Medium (feature works without meetings)

### 2. Graph Token Management

**Impact:** Token retrieval is stubbed out

**Workaround:** None needed until meeting scheduling is implemented

**Priority:** Low (not blocking)

### 3. No Unit Tests

**Impact:** Changes not covered by automated tests

**Workaround:** Manual testing and monitoring

**Priority:** High (should be added soon)

## Success Criteria

- [x] Announcements processed as AnnouncementMetadata throughout
- [x] No conversion to ChangeMetadata
- [x] Separate handlers for announcements
- [x] Type-specific email templates
- [x] Cleanup script created
- [x] Documentation complete
- [ ] "Untitled announcement" bug fixed (pending deployment)
- [ ] Email delivery working (pending deployment)
- [ ] No data loss (pending deployment)

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy and Test**
   - Run cleanup script
   - Deploy Lambda code
   - Test announcement lifecycle

2. **Implement Meeting Scheduling**
   - Extract MeetingScheduler to shared package
   - Implement Graph API integration
   - Add token management

3. **Add Tests**
   - Unit tests for processor

   - Fix any issues

## Conclusion

Successfully implemented the core architecture for separate announcement processing. The "Untitled announcement" bug should be fixed once deployed, as announcements now maintain their data integrity throughout processing. Meeting scheduling is stubbed out but ready for future implementation.
