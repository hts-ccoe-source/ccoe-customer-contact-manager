# Multi-Customer SES Operations Documentation Update

## Summary

Updated help text and documentation for the new multi-customer SES operations feature, providing comprehensive guidance on using `-all` actions to manage SES across multiple customer accounts concurrently.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Help Text (main.go)

Enhanced the `showSESUsage()` function with:

**Clarified Action Descriptions:**
- Added "(single customer)" suffix to single-customer actions for clarity
- Emphasized "ALL customers concurrently" for multi-customer actions
- Maintained consistent formatting and organization

**Enhanced Flag Documentation:**
- Added notes that `--customer-code` and `--ses-role-arn` cannot be used with `-all` actions
- Clarified that `--config-file` is REQUIRED for all `-all` actions
- Documented `--max-customer-concurrency` flag with default behavior explanation
- Added clear notes about flag restrictions and requirements

**New Multi-Customer Operations Section:**
- Added dedicated section explaining `-all` suffix actions
- Listed key features: concurrent processing, error isolation, aggregated results
- Documented requirements and restrictions
- Provided clear guidance on when to use multi-customer vs single-customer actions

**Comprehensive Examples:**
- Added examples for all four `-all` actions
- Included dry-run examples
- Demonstrated concurrency control usage
- Showed both unlimited and limited concurrency scenarios
