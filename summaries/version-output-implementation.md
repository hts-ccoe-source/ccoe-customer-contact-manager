# Version Output Implementation

## Summary

Added automatic version information output at the beginning of every CLI execution, displaying version number, git commit hash, and build timestamp.

## Changes Made

### 1. Version Output in main()
**Location**: `main.go` (line ~91)

Added version output immediately after the Lambda environment check:
```go
// Display version information at startup
fmt.Printf("CCOE Customer Contact Manager v%s (commit: %s, built: %s)\n\n", Version, GitCommit, BuildTime)
```

## Existing Infrastructure

The version variables were already defined at the top of main.go:
```go
var (
    Version   = "1.0.0"
    BuildTime = "unknown"
    GitCommit = "unknown"
)
```

The Makefile already had proper LDFLAGS to inject these values during build:
```makefile
LDFLAGS=-ldflags "-X main.Version=$(VERSION) -X main.BuildTime=$(BUILD_TIME) -X main.GitCommit=$(GIT_COMMIT)"
```

## Output Format

The version information is displayed in a compact single-line format:
```
CCOE Customer Contact Manager vlatest (commit: 91c03e6, built: 2025-10-22_03:48:26)
```

This appears at the beginning of every command execution, providing immediate visibility into:
- **Version**: The release version (default: "latest", can be overridden with `VERSION=x.y.z make build-local`)
- **Commit**: Short git commit hash (7 characters)
- **Build Time**: UTC timestamp in format YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:SS

## Build Instructions

To build with proper version information:

```bash
# Local development build (uses current git commit and timestamp)
make build-local

# Build with specific version
VERSION=1.2.3 make build-local

# Lambda deployment build
make build-lambda
```

## Example Output

```bash
$ ./ccoe-customer-contact-manager ses --action help
CCOE Customer Contact Manager vlatest (commit: 91c03e6, built: 2025-10-22_03:48:26)

SES command usage:
...
```

```bash
$ ./ccoe-customer-contact-manager version
CCOE Customer Contact Manager vlatest (commit: 91c03e6, built: 2025-10-22_03:48:26)

CCOE Customer Contact Manager
Version: latest
Build Time: 2025-10-22_03:48:26
Git Commit: 91c03e6
```

## Benefits

1. **Immediate Visibility**: Version info appears at the start of every execution
2. **Debugging Support**: Commit hash helps identify exact code version
3. **Build Tracking**: Timestamp helps track when binary was built
4. **Minimal Overhead**: Single line output doesn't clutter the interface
5. **Lambda Compatibility**: Skipped in Lambda environment to avoid unnecessary logs

## Testing

- ✅ Version output displays correctly on all commands
- ✅ Lambda environment check prevents output in Lambda mode
- ✅ Makefile properly injects version variables during build
- ✅ Format is compact and informative
