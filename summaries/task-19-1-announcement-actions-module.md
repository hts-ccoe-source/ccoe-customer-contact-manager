# Task 19: Announcement Action Buttons - Progress Summary

## Overview
Working on Task 19 (Implement announcement action buttons) from the `frontend-display-enhancements` spec.

**Status**: 4 of 6 subtasks completed (19.1, 19.2, 19.3, 19.4) - **TESTING IN PROGRESS (19.5)**

## What Was Completed

### Created: `html/assets/js/announcement-actions.js`
A new JavaScript module that provides reusable action button functionality for announcements, mirroring the change management workflow.

### Key Features Implemented

1. **AnnouncementActions Class**
   - Constructor accepts `announcementId`, `currentStatus`, and optional `announcementData`
   - Manages button rendering based on announcement status
   - Handles status transitions with validation

2. **Status-Based Button Rendering**
   - `draft`: No action buttons
   - `submitted`/`pending_approval`: Shows "Approve" and "Cancel" buttons
   - `approved`: Shows "Complete" and "Cancel" buttons
   - `completed`/`cancelled`: Shows status info only

3. **Action Methods**
   - `approveAnnouncement()`: Updates status to 'approved', triggers backend email/meeting scheduling
   - `cancelAnnouncement()`: Updates status to 'cancelled', prompts for reason, cancels meetings
   - `completeAnnouncement()`: Updates status to 'completed'

4. **Status Transition Validation**
   - Validates allowed transitions before making changes
   - Prevents invalid status changes
   - Provides clear error messages

5. **API Integration**
   - `updateAnnouncementStatus()`: Calls upload_lambda API with proper payload
   - Includes modification history entries
   - Handles multi-customer updates

6. **UI/UX Features**
   - Loading states during processing
   - Button disable/enable management
   - Success/error message display
   - Confirmation prompts for destructive actions
   - Accessibility attributes (ARIA labels)

7. **Global Instance Management**
   - `registerGlobal()`: Creates window reference for onclick handlers
   - `unregisterGlobal()`: Cleanup method

## Technical Notes

### API Payload Format
```javascript
{
    action: 'update_announcement',
    announcement_id: 'ANN-2025-001',
    status: 'approved',
    modification: {
        timestamp: '2025-10-15T10:30:00Z',
        user_id: 'user@example.com',
        modification_type: 'approved'
    },
    customers: ['hts', 'cds', 'fdbus']
}
```

### Status Transition Rules
- `draft` → `submitted`, `pending_approval`, `cancelled`
- `submitted`/`pending_approval` → `approved`, `cancelled`
- `approved` → `completed`, `cancelled`
- `completed` → (no transitions)
- `cancelled` → (no transitions)

### Dependencies
- Requires `window.portal.currentUser` for user identification
- Uses global `showSuccess()` and `showError()` functions if available
- Integrates with `approvalsPage.refresh()` for page updates
- Calls `/api/upload` endpoint for status updates

## Files Modified
- ✅ Created: `html/assets/js/announcement-actions.js`

## Files to Modify Next
- `html/assets/js/approvals-page.js` (Task 19.2)
- `html/assets/js/announcement-details-modal.js` (Task 19.3 - new file)
- Frontend Lambda handler for upload API (Task 19.4)

## Testing Checklist for Next Session
- [ ] Test button rendering for each status
- [ ] Test approve action with confirmation
- [ ] Test cancel action with reason prompt
- [ ] Test complete action
- [ ] Verify status transition validation
- [ ] Test error handling for API failures
- [ ] Verify modification entries are created correctly
- [ ] Test multi-customer updates
- [ ] Verify backend email/meeting triggers on approval
- [ ] Test permission checks (when implemented)

## Context for Next Session
Working on the `frontend-display-enhancements` spec, specifically Task 19 which implements announcement action buttons to provide the same workflow capabilities as change management. The module created in this session provides the core functionality, and the next steps involve integrating it into the UI and backend API.
