# Task 15: Documentation Complete ✅

## Overview

Created comprehensive documentation for the new structured logging system and summary statistics.

## Deliverables

### 1. Logging Standards Guide (`docs/logging-standards.md`)

**Comprehensive 400+ line guide covering:**

#### Quick Reference
- Log level decision matrix (Error/Warn/Info/Debug)
- When to use each level with examples

#### Core Principles
- Use structured logging (key-value pairs)
- Log sparingly (80%+ reduction target)
- Use summary statistics instead of individual logs
- No emoji in logs

#### Detailed Log Level Guidelines
- **Error**: Operation failures, exceptions, what to include
- **Warn**: Unexpected conditions, fallback behavior
- **Info**: Critical operations, summary statistics
- **Debug**: Detailed troubleshooting (disabled by default)

#### What NOT to Log
- Routine success messages
- Step-by-step progress
- Verbose operation details
- Sensitive information
- Duplicate information

#### Structured Logging Best Practices
- Consistent field names (error, customer, change_id, etc.)
- Group related fields
- Use appropriate types
- Include context for troubleshooting

#### Passing Logger Through Functions
- Standard pattern with logger parameter
- Using slog.Default() when needed

#### ExecutionSummary Pattern
- Complete structure documentation
- Usage examples (initialize, track, log)
- Adding new metrics (5-step process)

#### CustomerLogBuffer Pattern
- When to use (concurrent operations)
- Implementation pattern
- Rules for usage

#### Migration Checklist
- 12-point checklist for new/modified code

### 2. Troubleshooting Guide (`docs/troubleshooting-with-logs.md`)

**Comprehensive 350+ line troubleshooting guide covering:**

#### Quick Start
- Finding Lambda execution summaries
- Finding errors and warnings
- CloudWatch Insights queries

#### Common Scenarios (6 detailed scenarios)
1. **Change Request Not Processing**
   - Investigation steps
   - CloudWatch queries
   - Common causes

2. **Email Not Sent**
   - Check email statistics
   - Find email errors
   - Common causes

3. **Meeting Not Created**

- Meeting Statistics interpretation
- S3 Operations interpretation
- Change Request Processing interpretation

#### Advanced Queries
- Find all activity for change ID
- Find all activity for customer
- Calculate success rate

#### Error Patterns and Solutions
- Common errors with causes and solutions
- "failed to download from S3"
- "failed to send email"
- "failed to create meeting"
- "no contacts subscribed to topic"
- "discarding backend event"

#### Monitoring Recommendations
- CloudWatch alarm configurations
- Dashboard widget suggestions

## Usage

### For Developers

1. **Adding new code**: Follow `docs/logging-standards.md`
2. **Adding new metrics**: See "Adding New Metrics" section
3. **Migration checklist**: Use checklist at end of standards doc

### For Operations

1. **Troubleshooting issues**: Use `docs/troubleshooting-with-logs.md`
2. **Understanding logs**: See "Understanding Summary Statistics" section
3. **Setting up monitoring**: See "Monitoring Recommendations" section

### For New Team Members

1. **Start with**: `docs/logging-standards.md` - Quick Reference
2. **Then read**: Core Principles and Log Levels sections
3. **Practice with**: Troubleshooting Guide scenarios

## Integration with Existing Documentation

### References to Other Docs

**Logging Standards references:**
- `.kiro/specs/reduce-backend-logging/summary-metrics-mapping.md` - Metric definitions
- `.kiro/specs/reduce-backend-logging/summary-verification-report.md` - Verification results
- `internal/lambda/summary.go` - Implementation

**Troubleshooting Guide references:**
- `docs/logging-standards.md` - Logging guidelines
- `.kiro/specs/reduce-backend-logging/summary-metrics-mapping.md` - Metric definitions

## Examples of Documentation Quality

### Example 1: Clear DO/DON'T Comparisons

```markdown
❌ **DON'T**: Use printf-style formatting
logger.Error("failed to process customer %s: %v", customerCode, err)

✅ **DO**: Use key-value pairs
logger.Error("failed to process customer", 
    "error", err,
    "customer", customerCode)
```

### Example 2: Ready-to-Use Queries

```
fields @timestamp, emails_sent, emails_before_filter, emails_filtered
| filter @message like /lambda execution complete/
| filter customers like /CUSTOMER_CODE/
| sort @timestamp desc
```

### Example 3: Step-by-Step Procedures

**Investigation Steps:**
1. Find the Lambda execution (with query)
2. Check for errors (with query)
3. Check if event was discarded (with query)
4. Check summary statistics (with query)
