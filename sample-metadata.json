    "implementationPlan": "1. Create RDS instance with Multi-AZ deployment\n2. Set up database replication from legacy system\n3. Perform data validation and testing\n4. Update application connection strings\n5. Switch traffic to new RDS instance\n6. Monitor performance and validate functionality",
    "testPlan": "1. Validate data integrity using checksums\n2. Run performance benchmarks\n3. Test application functionality in staging environment\n4. Verify backup and restore procedures\n5. Test failover scenarios\n6. Conduct user acceptance testing",
    "expectedCustomerImpact": "Brief downtime of approximately 15 minutes during the final cutover. Users may experience slower response times during the initial 30 minutes as caches warm up. No data loss is expected.",
    "rollbackPlan": "1. Stop application traffic to RDS\n2. Revert DNS/connection strings to legacy database\n3. Restart application services\n4. Validate legacy system functionality\n5. Communicate rollback completion to stakeholders",
