# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec defines the requirements for completing the integration of functions from the original monolithic `ccoe-customer-contact-manager-original.go.bak` file into the existing modular codebase structure. The codebase has been partially modularized, but critical functions for alternate contact management, AWS utilities, and workflow orchestration remain in the original file and need to be extracted and properly integrated. The goal is to ensure all functionality is preserved while maintaining clean separation of concerns and eliminating code duplication.

The bulk of the functions inside `ccoe-customer-contact-manager-original.go.bak` are presumed to be 'more complete' than the functions scattered among the modular files.

We need to take a function-by-function approach.  Get each function from `ccoe-customer-contact-manager-original.go.bak` and check to see if they exist inside another modular file.  If they do not, then import them as such:

1. Core AWS Utility Functions (should go in a new file like aws_utils.go):
CreateConnectionConfiguration - Creates AWS config from credentials
GetManagementAccountIdByPrefix - Gets management account ID by org prefix
GetCurrentAccountId - Gets current AWS account ID
IsManagementAccount - Checks if current account is management account
AssumeRole - Assumes AWS IAM role
GetAllAccountsInOrganization - Lists all accounts in organization

2. Alternate Contact Functions (should go in a new file like alternate_contacts.go):
GetAlternateContact - Gets alternate contact info
SetAlternateContact - Sets alternate contact info
DeleteAlternateContact - Deletes alternate contact
CheckIfContactExists - Checks if contact exists
SetAlternateContactIfNotExists - Sets contact if not exists
SetContactsForSingleOrganization - set contacts workflow for single org
SetContactsForAllOrganizations - set contacts workflow for all orgs
DeleteContactsFromOrganization - Delete contacts workflow

3. Additional SES Functions (need to be added to ses.go):
Several SES functions that are more complete in the original
Email template functions
Microsoft Graph integration functions

4. Missing Types and Structs (need to be added to types.go):
Organization struct
AlternateContactConfig struct
Various other types

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Function Integration Analysis

**User Story:** As a developer working on the AWS Contact Manager codebase, I want to systematically identify and catalog all functions that exist in the original monolithic file but are missing from the modular files, so that I can complete the modularization without losing any functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the original backup file THEN the system SHALL identify all function definitions that are not present in the modular files
2. WHEN comparing function signatures THEN the system SHALL detect any differences in implementation between original and modular versions
3. WHEN functions exist in both locations THEN the system SHALL determine which version should be preserved based on completeness and functionality
4. IF duplicate functions exist THEN the system SHALL consolidate them into a single, complete implementation

### Requirement 2: Core AWS Utility Functions Integration

**User Story:** As a developer implementing alternate contact management workflows, I want all core AWS utility functions (credential management, organization handling, role assumption) to be properly integrated into the modular codebase, so that the contact management operations can authenticate and interact with AWS services correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system needs AWS configuration management THEN it SHALL have access to `CreateConnectionConfiguration` function
2. WHEN working with organizations THEN the system SHALL have access to `GetManagementAccountIdByPrefix`, `IsManagementAccount`, and `GetAllAccountsInOrganization` functions
3. WHEN handling AWS credentials THEN the system SHALL have access to `AssumeRole` and `GetCurrentAccountId` functions
4. WHEN accessing configuration paths THEN the system SHALL have a unified `GetConfigPath` function without duplicates
5. IF functions already exist in modular files THEN they SHALL be enhanced rather than duplicated

### Requirement 3: Alternate Contact Management Functions

**User Story:** As a system administrator managing AWS alternate contacts across multiple organizations, I want all the core contact management functions (get, set, delete, check existence) and workflow orchestration functions (single org, all orgs, bulk delete) to be available in the modular codebase, so that I can manage contacts efficiently without relying on the monolithic original file.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing individual contacts THEN the system SHALL provide `GetAlternateContact`, `SetAlternateContact`, `DeleteAlternateContact`, and `CheckIfContactExists` functions
2. WHEN setting contacts conditionally THEN the system SHALL provide `SetAlternateContactIfNotExists` with overwrite capability
3. WHEN processing organizations THEN the system SHALL provide `SetContactsForSingleOrganization`, `SetContactsForAllOrganizations`, and `DeleteContactsFromOrganization` functions
4. IF these functions exist in multiple files THEN they SHALL be consolidated into the appropriate modular file
5. WHEN functions are moved THEN all import dependencies SHALL be properly resolved

### Requirement 4: SES and Email Template Functions

**User Story:** As a system operator managing change notifications and approvals, I want the complete SES functionality including email templates, Microsoft Graph integration, and advanced contact management features from the original file to be properly integrated into the modular SES module, so that I can send rich notifications, approval requests, and meeting invites without missing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sending emails THEN the system SHALL have complete template processing functions
2. WHEN creating meeting invites THEN the system SHALL have Microsoft Graph API integration functions
3. WHEN managing SES contacts THEN the system SHALL have all contact list management functions from the original file
4. WHEN functions exist in both original and modular files THEN the most complete version SHALL be preserved
5. IF helper functions are missing THEN they SHALL be extracted and integrated appropriately

### Requirement 5: File Organization and Module Structure

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the AWS Contact Manager codebase, I want functions to be organized logically across modular files with clear separation of concerns (AWS utilities, alternate contacts, SES operations, workflows), so that the codebase is maintainable and new developers can easily understand and contribute to specific functional areas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing AWS utility functions THEN they SHALL be placed in an appropriate utility module
2. WHEN organizing alternate contact functions THEN they SHALL be grouped together in a dedicated module
3. WHEN organizing SES functions THEN they SHALL be consolidated in the existing `ses.go` file
4. WHEN organizing workflow functions THEN they SHALL be placed with their related domain functions
5. IF new modules are needed THEN they SHALL follow the existing naming conventions

### Requirement 6: Import and Dependency Resolution

**User Story:** As a developer working with the modular codebase, I want all Go imports and dependencies to be properly resolved and consolidated, so that the entire codebase compiles cleanly without duplicate imports, missing dependencies, or circular references.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN functions are moved between files THEN all required imports SHALL be included
2. WHEN duplicate imports exist THEN they SHALL be consolidated
3. WHEN missing dependencies are identified THEN they SHALL be added to the appropriate files
4. WHEN the integration is complete THEN all Go files SHALL compile without errors
5. IF module dependencies are missing THEN they SHALL be identified and documented

### Requirement 7: Function Signature Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer integrating functions into the modular codebase, I want to ensure that function signatures remain compatible with any existing callers in the modular files, so that the integration doesn't introduce breaking changes that would require extensive refactoring of dependent code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN functions are integrated THEN their signatures SHALL remain compatible with existing usage
2. WHEN function implementations are enhanced THEN backward compatibility SHALL be maintained
3. WHEN duplicate functions are consolidated THEN the most complete signature SHALL be preserved
4. IF signature changes are necessary THEN they SHALL be documented and justified
5. WHEN integration is complete THEN existing function calls SHALL continue to work

### Requirement 8: Testing and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer completing the modularization of the AWS Contact Manager, I want to validate that the integration preserves all functionality and that the modular codebase compiles and functions correctly, so that I can confidently retire the original monolithic file without losing any capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integration is complete THEN all files SHALL compile successfully
2. WHEN functions are moved THEN their functionality SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN duplicate functions are removed THEN no functionality SHALL be lost
4. IF compilation errors occur THEN they SHALL be resolved before completion
5. WHEN the integration is finished THEN a summary of changes SHALL be provided
