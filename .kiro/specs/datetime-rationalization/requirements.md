# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application currently has inconsistent date/time handling across different components, leading to parsing errors, timezone confusion, and formatting issues. The system consists of multiple components written in different languages: Go Lambda backend, Node.js frontend API, and Node.js authorizer Lambda at edge function. We need to establish a standardized approach for storing, processing, and converting date/time values throughout the entire system to ensure reliability and consistency across all components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a standardized internal date/time format, so that all components can reliably process temporal data without parsing errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system processes any date/time input THEN it SHALL convert it to a standard internal format (RFC3339/ISO8601 with timezone)
2. WHEN storing date/time values in data structures THEN the system SHALL use Go's time.Time type internally
3. WHEN serializing date/time to JSON THEN the system SHALL use RFC3339 format with timezone information
4. WHEN parsing external date/time inputs THEN the system SHALL handle multiple common formats gracefully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want consistent timezone handling, so that meeting times and schedules are accurate across different regions and systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing date/time with timezone information THEN the system SHALL preserve the original timezone
2. WHEN no timezone is specified THEN the system SHALL apply a configurable default timezone
3. WHEN converting between timezones THEN the system SHALL use Go's time package location handling
4. WHEN displaying times to users THEN the system SHALL format them in the appropriate timezone context

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an integration developer, I want format conversion functions, so that date/time values can be properly formatted for different external systems (Microsoft Graph, email templates, etc.).

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN formatting for Microsoft Graph API THEN the system SHALL use the exact format required by the API
2. WHEN formatting for email templates THEN the system SHALL use human-readable formats with timezone
3. WHEN formatting for calendar invites THEN the system SHALL use appropriate calendar standards (ICS format)
4. WHEN formatting for logging THEN the system SHALL use consistent timestamp formats

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user entering meeting information, I want flexible input parsing, so that I can enter dates and times in natural formats without strict formatting requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users input dates THEN the system SHALL accept formats like "2025-01-15", "01/15/2025", "January 15, 2025"
2. WHEN users input times THEN the system SHALL accept formats like "10:00", "10:00:00", "10:00 AM", "22:00"
3. WHEN users input combined date/time THEN the system SHALL parse ISO8601, RFC3339, and common local formats
4. WHEN parsing fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with format examples

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system maintainer, I want centralized date/time utilities, so that all date/time operations are consistent and maintainable across the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any component needs date/time parsing THEN it SHALL use centralized utility functions
2. WHEN any component needs date/time formatting THEN it SHALL use centralized utility functions
3. WHEN adding new date/time operations THEN they SHALL be added to the centralized utilities
4. WHEN updating date/time handling THEN changes SHALL be made in one place and affect all consumers

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer debugging issues, I want consistent date/time validation, so that invalid temporal data is caught early with clear error messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating date ranges THEN the system SHALL ensure start times are before end times
2. WHEN validating meeting times THEN the system SHALL ensure they are in the future (with configurable tolerance)
3. WHEN validating timezone data THEN the system SHALL verify timezone identifiers are valid
4. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages indicating the problem

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want unified date/time handling across all system components, so that data flows seamlessly between Go Lambda backend, Node.js frontend API, and Node.js authorizer Lambda without temporal data corruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Go Lambda backend processes date/time data THEN it SHALL use standardized parsing and formatting functions
2. WHEN the Node.js frontend API handles date/time data THEN it SHALL use equivalent standardized functions that produce identical results to the Go backend
3. WHEN the Node.js authorizer Lambda processes date/time data THEN it SHALL use the same standardized approach as other components
4. WHEN date/time data is passed between components THEN it SHALL maintain consistency and not require component-specific transformations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer working across multiple components, I want documented date/time standards and utilities, so that I can implement consistent temporal handling regardless of the programming language.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing date/time functionality in Go THEN there SHALL be documented utility functions and patterns to follow
2. WHEN implementing date/time functionality in Node.js THEN there SHALL be equivalent documented utility functions and patterns
3. WHEN adding new date/time features THEN the implementation SHALL be consistent across all three components (Go Lambda, Node.js API, Node.js authorizer)
4. WHEN onboarding new developers THEN they SHALL have clear documentation on date/time handling standards for each component
