# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature redesigns the announcement email templates to properly reflect their purpose as customer-facing event notifications. The current "approved-announcement" template incorrectly emphasizes approval workflow details rather than the actual event or experience being announced. This redesign will transform announcement emails into clear, engaging customer notifications that highlight event details, meeting information, and relevant content while de-emphasizing internal workflow metadata.

## Glossary

- **Email Template System**: The Go-based template generation system in `internal/ses/templates/` that creates HTML and text emails
- **Announcement Email**: Customer-facing notification about events, experiences, or important information (CIC, FinOps, InnerSource categories)
- **Approved Announcement**: The primary customer notification sent after internal approval, containing event details and meeting information
- **Template Builder**: Interface implementations (AnnouncementTemplateBuilder, ChangeTemplateBuilder) that generate emails for specific event types
- **Template Registry**: Central registry that routes template generation requests to appropriate builders
- **Event Details**: Information about the announced event including title, description, timing, and participation instructions
- **Meeting Metadata**: Calendar information including start time, end time, and join URL
- **Customer Notification**: The primary purpose of announcement emails - informing customers about events and experiences
- **Workflow Metadata**: Internal approval and tracking information that should be de-emphasized in customer-facing emails
