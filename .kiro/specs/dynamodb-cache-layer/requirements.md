# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a DynamoDB cache layer to the existing S3-based document storage system for the CCOE Customer Contact Manager. The system currently stores change metadata and announcement documents in S3 with key-prefixes for filtering and uses S3 events for notifications. While functional, S3 list operations filtered by time range can be slow. This enhancement introduces a write-through DynamoDB cache to accelerate read operations, particularly time-range queries and single-object lookups, while maintaining S3 as the source of truth for durability and event-driven workflows.

## Glossary

- **System**: The CCOE Customer Contact Manager application
- **DynamoDB_Cache**: The DynamoDB table used for caching document metadata
- **S3_Storage**: The existing S3 bucket storing document objects
- **Change_Document**: A JSON document representing a change request with metadata
- **Announcement_Document**: A JSON document representing an announcement with metadata
- **Time_Range_Query**: A query filtering documents by creation or modification timestamp
- **Write_Through_Cache**: A caching pattern where writes go to cache first, then to backing store
- **Cache_Entry**: A single item in the DynamoDB cache representing a document
- **TTL_Attribute**: DynamoDB Time-To-Live attribute for automatic cache expiration
- **S3_Event_Handler**: Lambda function triggered by S3 events to update cache
- **Fallback_Read**: Reading from S3 when DynamoDB cache is unavailable or missing data

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want fast time-range queries for recent documents, so that dashboard loading and filtering operations complete quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the System performs a time-range query for documents, THE DynamoDB_Cache SHALL return results within 200 milliseconds for queries covering the last 90 days
2. WHEN the System performs a time-range query, THE DynamoDB_Cache SHALL support filtering by customer code, status, and object type
3. WHERE DynamoDB_Cache is unavailable, THE System SHALL fall back to S3_Storage for time-range queries
4. THE System SHALL log cache hit and miss metrics for time-range queries

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want single-object lookups to be fast, so that viewing individual change or announcement details is responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the System retrieves a single document by ID, THE DynamoDB_Cache SHALL return the document within 50 milliseconds
2. WHERE the document is not found in DynamoDB_Cache, THE System SHALL retrieve it from S3_Storage
3. THE System SHALL update DynamoDB_Cache with the document retrieved from S3_Storage
4. THE System SHALL support concurrent single-object lookups with rate limiting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want writes to be idempotent and consistent, so that the system remains reliable during failures and retries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the System writes a document, THE System SHALL write to DynamoDB_Cache before writing to S3_Storage
2. IF the DynamoDB_Cache write fails, THEN THE System SHALL not write to S3_Storage
3. IF the S3_Storage write fails after DynamoDB_Cache write succeeds, THEN THE System SHALL remove the entry from DynamoDB_Cache
4. THE System SHALL support retry with exponential backoff for both DynamoDB_Cache and S3_Storage operations
5. THE System SHALL ensure all write operations are fully idempotent

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the cache to stay synchronized with S3, so that direct S3 writes are reflected in query results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an S3_Event_Handler receives an S3 PUT event, THE S3_Event_Handler SHALL update DynamoDB_Cache with the document metadata
2. WHEN an S3_Event_Handler receives an S3 DELETE event, THE S3_Event_Handler SHALL remove the entry from DynamoDB_Cache
3. THE S3_Event_Handler SHALL handle events with exponential backoff and retry
4. THE S3_Event_Handler SHALL log all cache synchronization operations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the cache to automatically expire old entries, so that storage costs remain controlled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE DynamoDB_Cache SHALL include a TTL_Attribute for automatic expiration
2. THE System SHALL set TTL_Attribute to 90 days from document creation for all Cache_Entry items
3. WHEN a Cache_Entry expires via TTL, THE System SHALL not delete the corresponding S3_Storage object
4. THE System SHALL support configurable TTL duration via environment variable

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want dry-run support for cache operations, so that I can test changes without affecting production data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the System runs in dry-run mode, THE System SHALL log all DynamoDB_Cache operations without executing them
2. WHEN the System runs in dry-run mode, THE System SHALL log all S3_Storage operations without executing them
3. THE System SHALL support dry-run mode for both CLI and Lambda execution modes
4. THE System SHALL clearly indicate dry-run mode in all log output

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want structured logging for cache operations, so that I can monitor performance and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL log all DynamoDB_Cache operations with structured JSON format
2. THE System SHALL include cache hit/miss status in query operation logs
3. THE System SHALL include operation duration in milliseconds for all cache operations
4. THE System SHALL support both JSON and text log output formats via configuration

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the cache implementation to follow existing project patterns, so that the codebase remains consistent and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL implement DynamoDB operations using AWS SDK v2 for Go
2. THE System SHALL organize cache code in internal/cache subdirectory
3. THE System SHALL support both manual CLI execution and Lambda-wrapper modes
4. THE System SHALL implement full concurrency support for cache operations
5. THE System SHALL implement API rate limiting with exponential backoff for DynamoDB operations
