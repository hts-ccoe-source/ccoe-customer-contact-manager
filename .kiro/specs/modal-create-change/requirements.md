# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing a modal-based change creation workflow that allows users to create new changes without leaving the my-changes.html page. The feature will improve user experience by providing a seamless, in-context creation flow with immediate feedback upon successful creation.

## Glossary

- **Modal**: A dialog overlay that appears on top of the current page content, requiring user interaction before returning to the underlying page
- **Create Change Form**: The form interface that collects metadata for creating a new change request
- **My Changes Page**: The page (my-changes.html) that displays a user's draft and submitted changes
- **Form Component**: A reusable JavaScript module that encapsulates the create change form logic and UI
- **Empty State**: The UI displayed when no items exist in a filtered view
- **Draft**: A change request that has been saved but not yet submitted for approval

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Modal-Based Change Creation

**User Story:** As a user viewing my changes, I want to create a new change in a modal overlay, so that I can quickly create changes without losing my current page context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the empty state area on the my-changes page with draft filter active, THE System SHALL display a modal overlay containing the create change form
2. WHEN the user clicks a "Create New Change" button in the navigation or page header, THE System SHALL display the same modal overlay
3. WHEN the modal is displayed, THE System SHALL dim the background page content to indicate modal focus
4. WHEN the modal is open, THE System SHALL prevent scrolling of the background page
5. WHEN the user presses the Escape key while the modal is open, THE System SHALL close the modal and return focus to the triggering element

### Requirement 2: Form Component Extraction

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the create change form to be a reusable component, so that it can be used in both standalone pages and modal contexts without code duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL extract the create change form logic into a standalone JavaScript module
2. THE System SHALL extract the create change form HTML template into a reusable structure
3. THE Form Component SHALL support initialization in both standalone page and modal contexts
4. THE Form Component SHALL expose methods for form submission, validation, and reset
5. THE Form Component SHALL emit events for form lifecycle actions (submit, cancel, success, error)

### Requirement 3: Modal User Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want the modal to be visually clear and easy to use, so that I can efficiently create changes without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Modal SHALL display a clear header with the title "Create New Change"
2. THE Modal SHALL include a close button (X) in the top-right corner
3. THE Modal SHALL be centered on the viewport with appropriate padding
4. THE Modal SHALL have a maximum width suitable for form content (800-1000px)
5. THE Modal SHALL be scrollable when form content exceeds viewport height
6. THE Modal SHALL include a semi-transparent backdrop that closes the modal when clicked
7. THE Modal SHALL display form validation errors inline within the modal

### Requirement 4: Form Submission and Feedback

**User Story:** As a user, I want immediate feedback when I create a change, so that I know my action was successful and can see the new change in my list.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user submits a valid form in the modal, THE System SHALL save the change as a draft
2. WHEN the draft is successfully saved, THE System SHALL close the modal automatically
3. WHEN the modal closes after successful save, THE System SHALL refresh the my-changes list to display the new draft
4. WHEN the modal closes after successful save, THE System SHALL display a success notification message
5. WHEN the draft save fails, THE System SHALL display an error message within the modal without closing it
6. WHEN the user clicks "Save as Draft" in the modal, THE System SHALL save the change and close the modal
7. WHEN the user clicks "Cancel" in the modal, THE System SHALL prompt for confirmation if the form has unsaved changes

### Requirement 5: Keyboard Accessibility

**User Story:** As a keyboard user, I want to navigate and interact with the modal using only my keyboard, so that I can create changes without requiring a mouse.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the modal opens, THE System SHALL move keyboard focus to the first form field
2. WHEN the user presses Tab within the modal, THE System SHALL cycle focus only among modal elements (focus trap)
3. WHEN the user presses Shift+Tab on the first focusable element, THE System SHALL move focus to the last focusable element
4. WHEN the user presses Escape, THE System SHALL close the modal and return focus to the triggering element
5. WHEN the modal closes, THE System SHALL restore keyboard focus to the element that opened the modal

### Requirement 6: Mobile Responsiveness

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the create change modal to work well on my device, so that I can create changes on the go.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the modal is displayed on a mobile device (viewport width < 768px), THE Modal SHALL occupy the full viewport width with minimal side margins
2. WHEN the modal is displayed on a mobile device, THE Modal SHALL be scrollable to access all form fields
3. WHEN the modal is displayed on a mobile device, THE Form SHALL stack form fields vertically for optimal touch interaction
4. WHEN the user interacts with form fields on mobile, THE System SHALL prevent zoom on input focus
5. WHEN the modal is open on mobile, THE System SHALL prevent background page scrolling

### Requirement 7: Standalone Page Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want the existing create-change.html page to continue working, so that I can use direct links and bookmarks to create changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE System SHALL maintain the existing create-change.html page as a standalone option
2. THE Standalone Page SHALL use the same Form Component as the modal implementation
3. THE Standalone Page SHALL redirect to my-changes.html after successful change creation
4. THE Standalone Page SHALL display the same validation rules and error messages as the modal
5. THE System SHALL support URL parameters for pre-filling form fields in both standalone and modal contexts

### Requirement 8: Announcement Creation Modal

**User Story:** As a user viewing announcements, I want to create new announcements in a modal overlay, so that I have a consistent creation experience across the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the empty state area on the announcements page with draft filter active, THE System SHALL display a modal overlay containing the create announcement form
2. THE Announcement Modal SHALL follow the same interaction patterns as the change creation modal
3. THE System SHALL extract the create announcement form into a reusable component
4. WHEN an announcement is successfully created, THE System SHALL refresh the announcements list
5. THE System SHALL maintain the existing create-announcement.html page as a standalone option

### Requirement 9: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages and recovery options when something goes wrong, so that I don't lose my work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a network error occurs during form submission, THE System SHALL display a retry option within the modal
2. WHEN the user closes the modal with unsaved changes, THE System SHALL prompt for confirmation
3. WHEN the user confirms closing with unsaved changes, THE System SHALL discard the form data
4. WHEN a validation error occurs, THE System SHALL highlight the invalid fields and display specific error messages
5. WHEN the user corrects validation errors, THE System SHALL remove error indicators in real-time

### Requirement 10: Performance and Loading States

**User Story:** As a user, I want the modal to open quickly and provide feedback during operations, so that I know the system is responding to my actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user triggers the modal, THE System SHALL display the modal within 200 milliseconds
2. WHEN the form is being submitted, THE System SHALL display a loading indicator on the submit button
3. WHEN the form is being submitted, THE System SHALL disable the submit button to prevent double submission
4. WHEN the form is loading initial data, THE System SHALL display a loading state within the modal
5. WHEN the modal closes, THE System SHALL animate the close transition smoothly (< 300ms)
