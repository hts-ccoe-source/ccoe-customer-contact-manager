# Multi-Customer Email Distribution Architecture

## Introduction

This spec addresses the architectural challenge of distributing change management emails across multiple customer AWS Organizations in a Managed Service Provider (MSP) environment. Currently, the AWS Alternate Contact Manager operates on a single account/organization basis, but we need to scale this to support ~30 customer organizations while maintaining proper isolation and security boundaries.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Customer Isolation

**User Story:** As a Managed Service Provider, I want each customer to have their own isolated SES contact lists and email management, so that customers cannot access or interfere with each other's email subscriptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a change affects multiple customers THEN each customer's emails SHALL be sent from their own organization's SES account
2. WHEN a customer manages their subscriptions THEN they SHALL only have access to their own organization's contact lists
3. WHEN email sending occurs THEN it SHALL use the appropriate customer's AWS credentials and SES configuration
4. IF a customer's SES service is unavailable THEN other customers' email delivery SHALL NOT be affected

### Requirement 2: Multi-Customer Change Distribution

**User Story:** As a change manager, I want to send change notifications to multiple customers affected by a single change, so that all stakeholders are informed through their preferred communication channels.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a metadata.json file contains multiple customer codes THEN the system SHALL identify all affected customers
2. WHEN sending emails THEN the system SHALL trigger email delivery processes for each affected customer organization
3. WHEN a customer is listed in metadata THEN their containerized CLI process SHALL receive the change information
4. IF a customer's email delivery fails THEN other customers' deliveries SHALL continue successfully

### Requirement 3: Containerized Process Orchestration

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want to trigger customer-specific email processes efficiently and reliably, so that change notifications are delivered promptly without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a change affects specific customers THEN only those customers' processes SHALL be triggered
2. WHEN triggering customer processes THEN the system SHALL use a scalable and reliable mechanism
3. WHEN a process is triggered THEN it SHALL receive the complete metadata.json file
4. WHEN multiple changes occur simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent processing without conflicts

### Requirement 4: Metadata Distribution

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want to distribute change metadata to the appropriate customer processes, so that each customer receives relevant change information in the correct format.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN metadata is generated THEN it SHALL be made available to all affected customer processes
2. WHEN a customer process starts THEN it SHALL have access to the complete metadata.json file
3. WHEN metadata contains customer-specific information THEN each customer SHALL receive the full context
4. IF metadata is updated THEN affected customer processes SHALL receive the updated information

### Requirement 5: Scalable Architecture

**User Story:** As a platform architect, I want the email distribution system to scale efficiently with the number of customers and changes, so that performance remains consistent as the MSP grows.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the number of customers increases THEN the system performance SHALL NOT degrade significantly
2. WHEN multiple changes occur simultaneously THEN the system SHALL process them efficiently
3. WHEN customer processes run concurrently THEN they SHALL NOT interfere with each other
4. WHEN system load is high THEN email delivery SHALL remain reliable and timely

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Monitoring

**User Story:** As an operations engineer, I want comprehensive error handling and monitoring for multi-customer email distribution, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues affecting specific customers.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a customer's email delivery fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be isolated to the affected customer without impacting others
3. WHEN processes are triggered THEN their status SHALL be trackable and monitorable
4. WHEN failures happen THEN appropriate alerts and notifications SHALL be generated

### Requirement 7: Security and Access Control

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want proper access controls and credential management for multi-customer operations, so that customer data and email systems remain secure and isolated.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN accessing customer AWS accounts THEN the system SHALL use appropriate IAM roles and credentials
2. WHEN storing or transmitting metadata THEN sensitive information SHALL be protected
3. WHEN customer processes run THEN they SHALL only access their own organization's resources
4. WHEN credentials are used THEN they SHALL follow the principle of least privilege
